Continue cooking, but without stirring, until mixture becomes golden amber in color. Remove from flame and set aside.</li><li>Whip the cream, gradually stir in the caramel syrup.</li><li>Add peanuts, stir and combine. Mixture must be smooth (at first it will foam up a little). Transfer the cream to a bowl to cool down to room temperature and thicken.</li><li>For the ganache bring the cream just to a boil over medium-high heat; pour over chocolate. Let stand 10 minutes. Stir very gently for 3-4 minutes until smooth and glossy, incorporating the cream steadily, without overworking.</li><li>Cool ganache for an hour or until completely chilled, then beat for 2-3 minutes or until it becomes fluffy and lighter in color. Do not overbeat because it will become too thick and not spreadable.</li><li>To assemble the cake, first sprinkle each cake layer with half of the rum and water syrup.</li><li>Spread the caramel cream over the bottom layer, cover with the top layer (wet side down).</li><li>Immediately spread ganache over top and sides of cake.</li></ol>",
